# DSA Python

My data structures & algorithms practice (LeetCode / NeetCode), plus notes and small applied mini-projects.

## Structure
- `notes/` — concepts + patterns (my own explanations)
- `problems/` — solved problems by topic
- `templates/` — reusable templates for problems and notes
- `tests/` — quick checks / unit tests

## How I work a problem
1. Identify pattern
2. Write brute force idea
3. Optimize
4. Implement
5. Add notes (complexity + key insight)
